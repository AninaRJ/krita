Krita

Krita is a free and opensource digital painting application. If you're 
reading this on Github, be aware that this is just a mirror. Our real
code repository home is KDE:

This repository contains the current, Qt5-based development version of
Krita. Stable Krita 2.9 is here:

If you're building on Windows you'll need to build some third-party
dependencies before you can build Krita. You should look at the README
in the 3rdparty folder for directions on how to set them up.
